We decided to follow our dreams of creating a digital marketing/design firm about a year and a half ago. The road has been long and hard, we slept on my father's couch in a trailer for 6 months, a dank basement (on the floor) with people who didn't really want us there for the last 9, sometimes living off ramen as we all have to sometimes.\n\nBut here we are, on the advent of our success, and Christopher Columbus messes it up. We have a large check coming in the mail, but we didn't get it today because of the holiday. We are currently staying in a Motel 6 for a week, to scout/establish places to live, as we FINALLY after a year and a half of hard work, destitution, doubt and confidence, and above all courage, enough money to get (and keep) ourselves afloat, and enough clientele to support us through the months. \nWe're getting an apartment with the money that's coming in (and of course food), but we had planned on renting a single bed motel room for a week for $259, which would've left us with more than enough for simple groceries. They only had a 2 bed avaliable, for about $290. We only had about $310 in cash at that point, so needless to say that the remainder of the money is gone, and we were reliant on that check coming in today to be able to eat. Christopher Columbus! Note, we have NO where else to stay besides outside, no family, nothing.\n\nWe haven't ate a meal in around 30 hours, and while we've gone much, much longer before (box of cheerios and a bag of Ore Ida fries for a week... lol) , we just really don't want to go through the slow agony of starving again, especially when we're so on the cusp of being self reliant.\n\nSo I ask if there's any kind soul out there that would bless us with a pizza tonight, with the full intention of us paying you back within the next few days if wanted. We have a LOT of work to do, and not eating for an entire day isn't exactly great on your concentration, especially when dealing with tedious stuff like coding.\n\nProof avaliable if needed :) thanks!",

Two weeks ago my SO and I went to visit our respective parents in our hometown. SO had just gotten his Masters and we were there to celebrate. SO grandmother has a heart attack the day after we arrive and is in the hospital the whole time we're there. She died 3 separate times and was revived. All planned celebrations are (rightfully) ceased. Return home a week and some later after grandma is stable to find that our power bill is in arrears thanks to a shitty roommate we had and they are threatening to shut off our power. They refuse to work out any kind of payment plan and more or less tell us 'all or nothing' by 6pm tomorrow or we're out of luck. Next, find out the oven mysteriously broke while we were away and can no longer cook anything decent. Found this out after I attempted to cook a frozen pizza and was horrified by the half cooked doughy mess slithering through the oven rack. Don't know where I'm getting the money for the power bill and probably going to have to pick up stakes and move back home... but please reddit, if I can use anything right now it's a random act of pizza. \n\n**TLDR: SO and I returned from visiting sick family member to discover our power is going to be turned off tomorrow; oven died and mangled a frozen pizza we were going to have for supper.**",

Today I had to make the unfortunate decision between paying bills and eating. Unfortunately, the bills prevailed. My anxiety shot through the roof today, and I had to leave class early because I was having a panic attack. I figure I could use a hug right now, but a pizza will more than suffice. I'm not expecting much of anything, even some words of kindness and encouragement would be much appreciated. There is some good news to all of this: I recently got hired full time as a programming analyst. Unfortunately I don't start until early next year, so I am stuck in this situation for a while. I will be more than glad to return the favor some day to anyone who decides to help.\n\nThanks!\n\nedit:\n\nI am actually a real person!

I'm very excited to start, but I still have some hoops to get through before I do (the conditions being a background check and drug test, both of which are all clean, so I'm not worried). \n\nSeeing as how I'm currently a broke college student, pizza is an awesome celebratory food, but I can't really afford it until I start the job. If someone would hook me up with a pizza now, then once I get my first paycheck I would gladly buy them a pizza, or I could pay it forward to someone else listing a request.\n\nI'd also like to make this interesting. I request that the kind, obviously good looking person who does this for me get me their own personal favorite pizza. There are no pizzas I've tried that I don't like, so don't be afraid I won't enjoy it. I promise I will. Or just troll me with the craziest franken-pizza you can design. I think that would be fun too.\n\nEDIT: I'm located in Central Florida",

I just moved to the area to be with her because I love her, and haven't been able to find a job to help support us yet, which is unfortunate because her roommate just bailed on her. I did manage to secure a 200/mo food stamp benefit, which renews on the first of the month. But we couldn't manage to make it stretch the whole month our first time around, and we've been living off Ramen since the weekend. I'm sure we'll be able to properly ration ourselves next month, if we're more careful. And I have no problem living on ramen. I just want to do something nice for her since I feel like I'm sitting on my ass all day not contributing anything, looking for jobs on craigslist while she's away at work/stuck on the bus. She's been really upset about the money situation lately, and I just want her to be happy. Unfortunately, she is not as pleased with the Ramen diet as I am. I would give anything to be able to give her something better than this to come home to.\n\nSorry for that wall of text/sob story.

Posting on my main won't do any good, I don't have any friends, much less anyone that knows me and likes me enough to help out. I understand if you choose to not help because of this, but I can also do my best to provide any proof you'd like within reason.\n\nTo keep it short and sweet, I don't have a place to stay right now. I have 2 degrees, recently graduated, but I did something stupid during my first year of college, and have a misdemeanor on my record that I believe has been preventing me from obtaining employment. I have been trying to save up to get it expunged but recently lost the retail job I did have over some really silly shenanigans (boss with nothing better to do than fire people). I managed to land a job interview this week, and was just notified I made it to round 2 on Monday, for a really decently paying position.\n\nI lived check to check, so as of today I'll be living out of my car for 2-4 weeks until a good friend of mine moves into town, who's going to let me stay with him. Food and money is scarce, no way to make ramen anymore, so it'll probably be the dollar menu for a while. I've got one tank of gas to last me. Could someone toss a papa john's gift card my way? They're all over town... I'd be eternally grateful! I can't post on /r/loans because I don't know when I'll be able to pay back, and no way of preparing food from /r/foodpantry, so I figured this is the only assistance subreddit that could really help, even if only a meal for the weekend. \n\nWell, that was not so short and sweet. Sorry... again &gt;_&lt;.\n\nps: If anyone knows of a way to make quick buck besides prostituting myself, please let me know. I'd be happy to do anything\n\n",

So i decided to lend him money for gas because the person seemed to be dressed properly, had a decent car, and didnt seem to be a scammer to me. he took me to the nearest atm and i thought he would just ask for 40 dollars for a full tank when he said that he would appreciate around 160 dollars which he could pay back this upcoming saturday. i had 100 dollars in my debit card...so i gave him 80. 20 for myself to buy some needed groceries. He then left repeatedly thanking me for my generosity and said that if i called him this saturday he would repay me the amount as well as a gift certificate at a restaurant that he works at. Now it is sunday, i called him around 10 times on saturday and has not picked up. At this point i am guessing that he isnt going to be paying me back and now i have no money for any kind of food and am very hungry atm. i cooked rice and ate it by itself because i didnt have anything to cook but i am still starving. i would appreciate any kind of kindness reddit",

How about waking up to a clean house AND dinner?\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have any money. I've been unemployed for 2 months now and must put all of what I have left into my credit card bills.\nIt's kind of uncomfortable asking others to feed you and your family, but I figured it wouldn't hurt.

        "request_text_edit_aware": "This is actually the long story short believe it or not, please excuse my terrible grammar its very late, and humans do not have an effective way of communicating how terrible a time my father and I are going through.\n\nI was forced to move in with my father and his second wife, (then my stepmom) I had to withdraw from my college classes mid semester and quit my job. After living with my father who is schizophrenic bi-polar it became clear that he was extremely depressed by his living situation. He was being used by his wife for money, my father is the kind of person that when you ask something of him it is hard/next to impossible for him to say no. My father was paying rent, utilities, and iphones for 5 members of my stepmother's family. This literally used up 100% of my fathers money monthly. He would stay at home and do nothing but surf and web and read books, all the while my stepmother would use her disability money to buy shit we could not afford and routinely overspend and cause us to have overdraft fees that my father had no way to pay for, I've covered for her mistakes countless times, whenever she overspends she sells something of the family's to cover for her mistakes, the last thing she sold was the family kayak which was bought before they were married, all the while she still would use checks that were in her name to buy fancy furniture, and useless junk. To make matters worse, the stepmother has a son who SMOKES coke and w/e else he can get his hands on. This waste of life step brother of mine decided to get his GF pregnant who then popped out twins (they are religious and don't believe in abortion) The drug addict stepbrother is now a father of two kids when he cannot even support himself, he and his GF have been on welfare since the babies were born and neither have gotten a job or even tried to get their GEDs (yes they dropped out of high school) Now the stepmother spends most of her money on supporting the two kids and her fuck up son, she gives him cash to buy pot, cigs (which they smoke in a closed garage with the kids) I witnessed my stepbrother use his food stamps to buy only ice cream instead of getting real food for his kids and himself. At one point my father confided in me that he had considered suicide, this eneraged me and I decided I would do anything in my power to show my father that this leach of a stepmother cared nothing for him and was using him (he was in love with her and was in denial) I ended up getting evidence that my stepmother had pawned my father digital camera when she said that he had probably lost it. My father confronted her about it and she stood fast in her lie, my father then saw the light that this women was indeed using him and cared nothing for her. (in their 4 years of marriage they only had sex once and on their anniversary my father got her flowers, a card and wanted to take her to dinner but, she ended up going to see her fuck up son's kids instead.) The evidence of her using him continued to rise and rise for a few months until my father decided that he was going to tell her that he wanted a divorce. She ended up ripping out our internet and storming off to her mother's while texting my dad that she wanted the divorce too and that we were not to damage any of her property (oh the irony) or that she would make the divorce as hard as possible and take as much as she could. This was about a week ago and we have begun packing our stuff and preparing to move out, she has no intention of helping pay for the cancellation fees for the phones/net/tv ect. Together we have gotten enough money to pay for one more month so that we have time to move out and into my father's parent's house. Current between the two of us we have about 10$ until our next paychecks and have been eating at my father's parents. I have had to witness my father cry and think of ways to comfort him, he knows that this bitch doesn't really care for him and it is for the best that he gets the divorce but its all really overwhelming even for me, I can't imagine what it is like for a person with a disability such as his. I don't even know what to provide for proof but here is a hate email that my stepmother sent my father after he told her he wanted a divorce, its actually comic at some parts and really shows her true colors, some context though, I clean up after myself not my stepbrother and his two kids.\n\n***YOU chose to allow your son to attack me and NEVER SAID HE WAS TO STOP!!!! A true husband protects his wife from everyone. Instead you sat there only saying I was to calm down. He is a spoiled brat because you never had him in your life. Where was he all those years until HE was going to be on the street. He disrespected your ex who you claim to care so much about. He has anger issues ANGER ISSUES. TEARING DOWN A DOOR God, what would he do to ME, someone he hates, if I didn't stand up to his lies. I fully intend to prove your precious camera, which, btw was purchased in your manic fit. We had all your fancy cameras as well as a perfectly good digital. Now, you make IT and that little devil separate us. I believe in Jesus Christ and AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, I WILL SERVE THE LORD. He believes in the internet..... PERIOD. I stopped feeling safe in my home when he attacked me the first time. He climbs on your lap makes me sick that you cannot see his making fun of you when he shakes your belly. He is a sick puppy. Everyone who has seen the ghostly boy says he is way strange the way he stays in his room all the time.\n\nI told you the sex was what I got hurt doing. I never spoke up as to why, but when you dropped the dream of the surgery I knew you wanted to be diabetic and heavy all your life. I lost respect for you because even your family was encouraging you. For all I know anyway, maybe they weren't and you hid it from me. All I know is you don't ever want to go do anything and I am a very active person when I am having a good day from absence of pain. At least I see people when I go shopping and I recycle instead of buying expensive items we cannot pay for.\n\nI have tried hard to keep a nice home for you and you have to be reminded to CLEAN CAT LITTER AND FEED. I can't do it all without feeling USED!\n\nI raised my kids to help out...what happened to your Ryan, he is above lifting a finger. Does he even know how to clean his own (mostly his) bathroom. Cleaners are right on shelf and I have pretty towels that makes it nice and he chooses to disrespect and not use his towels instead. What disrespect.\n\nI am not a happy person now or before I left there.\n\nI hope you are happy that you allow your baby boy to separate us. YOU DID THIS.\n\nMy son WILL BE HELPING ME MOVE SO MAKE RYAN GO TO HIS MIKEY'S HOUSE WHEN WE ARE MOVING. My Son is angry for what unhappiness his Mother is under because of little boy Satan. Dustin told me two months ago that Ryan is pushing us to divorce. Pretty smart boy who adores his Mom. Dustin and Roy protect Me like you will not. ***\n\nI have no idea if anyone will even read all this as it is 2 am and I did a horrible job of explaining our situation but if anyone would like clarification you can add me on skype rcroslin@live.com\n",

I know that as a new redditor I probably won't get anywhere right off, but I figured I'd give it a try as I'm tired (and nearly out of) of ramen.\n\nManagement at my work has cut all of the cashiers' hours down to 25hrs a week. As it is, I barely could afford to pay rent and utilities and get decent food before the cuts... and now, I'm living off of however much ramen I can buy with my paycheck and still keep my bank accounts open, which is not good since my car is still (hopefully) waiting for me to pay off its repair bills.\n\nAnd to top it all off... I'm currently sleeping on an air mattress, as my regular one is infested with Bedbugs, courtesy of my apartment complex.\n\nThis year is not being kind to me so far &gt;.&lt;\n\nFor proof... an image of my pantry: http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6219/photo0074e.jpg\n\nTo anyone who helps, a big thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\n--Christopher\n\n*Christopher sets off to discover what Reddit is all about*",

I busted my ass off to get a special grant from the state this year so that I could afford to finish my final year of my undergraduate degree. Each semester this is $2500, and really it just helps me pay rent and utilities. (My mom passed away a year ago, and my father is currently squatting in house in the Appalachians somewhere. I literally have nowhere to go if I can't afford a place to live.)\n\nWell, I am still waiting on the grant money for this semester. My case worker contacted me 10 days ago saying she had just caught something she missed, and I should expect the school to receive payment in \"a few weeks\"... And I'm still waiting.\n\nThankfully I just got a part time job working 12-10 sat &amp; sun. But my first paycheck is largely going to pay my recently increased Comcast bill and my cellphone, which I haven't had on since March 22. My birthday was on March 27, and I didn't get a single present or phone call because I can't pay my phone bill. I am behind on my rent. I've been surviving off of 1-2 packets of ramen a day for the past 3 weeks. \n\nI could really just use a hug... or an internet hug in the form of a pizza...\n\nAnd fully plan on pizza-ing someone the second I can afford to.

I'm the last person who would ever ask for anything, and perhaps that is why we have lived in such rough shape for so long, but I figured I would give it a shot. Maybe it will delay another day and something will come along. Thanks in advance for helping us, or for any who considered..\n\nUPDATE:\nPeople are amazing. We have had some wonderful people offer us assistance. Thank you to those who have helped and those who have offered. We received a Random act of Dominos from the one and only flamingcow. We also will be receiving a grocery gift card soon from another wonderful person. Again, we're taken back by the generosity. We're not used to receiving such gifts. There are amazingly good people out there.\n\nP.S. - I can only hope that we can be as generous to others once things have turned around for us.\n\nMORE EDITS:\nWow people have been generous to us, we just got another gift of Pizza Hut today completely unexpected! Thank you very much! (I'm not sure if they want to be named publicly so I won't do so unless I have their permission). We can't wait to be good enough financially to be able to give the gift of pizza/food to others in need in the future!",

My family and I are in dire need, and I just don't know what to do anymore. I've been homeless before, and had to do without, but I'm struggling at my last wits to hold on this time.\n\n\nI just can't let my children go through that, and by the grace of God, a blessing will come. You see, I've spent my last just so my kids could eat something; no cash, no savings, no credit, nothing. I've applied for food stamps, but it will be nearly a week before we receive them. So, in the meantime, I don't know what we're going to do. I don't have a car or any transportation, for that matter, so I can't get to a food bank or pantry. Believe me, I've thought about it, but I'm literally stranded. We have no family out here.\n\n\nMy husband is out of work due to injury, and I've been out of work due to my health. We have been trying to make it by doing work for people online, like building websites, writing articles, building backlinks, and so on. It's been tough, however, because for every legit job we get, it seems someone else tries to get over on us. For the sake of our children, though, we push on.\n\n\nI don't want to go into all the details publicly, but it's really hard for us these days. We're barely scraping by. We're just a day or two away from homelessness (you can PM for more info), and what's worse is that we can't get any help. We've tried, and been turned away. It's sad. When you need help, I mean really need it, you can't get it.\n\n\nFor the past couple of days, we've only had enough food for the kids to eat, so we've gone without. As long as they have what they need, we will be okay. They are what matters most to us, and so, we sacrifice for them. We don't get much sleep for worrying and trying to make enough money just to get by. Between the stress and worry, I'm surprised that we can even hold a thought.\n\n\nI cry sometimes, a lot actually, and I wonder, if our efforts are in vain. It seems like everything is working against us, no matter how hard we push forward, we just can't stay ahead. It's wearing me down, that's for sure, but I know that our breakthrough is coming. Somehow, and someway, we are going to make it.\n\n\nIt's just so tiring to try, and try, and try, and not get anywhere. And what I've told you here is not the half of it. If anyone can help, I will give you the info (verification) that you need of our situation.\n\n\nI'm just hoping, that at least tonight, someone can help us out. Pizza isn't much, but it's something. And I'll be thankful for it. It will help us to get through another tough night, just a little easier.\n\n\n\n\n---family of 7 from Irving, Texas (just after 8PM)\n\n\n(had to repost to include -request- in the title, just following the rules)",

I work in a call center in a little cubicle where my only joy is seeing the clock hit 7pm. I sit in a chair and get yelled at for 8 hours. Sometimes 16 hours, because my boss likes to tell me that his star agent has taken off and he needs me to cover their shift. This rockstar agent also likes to come in late and is related to the head manager so..why would I complain about him? Who would I complain to? He's a pain in my ass always asking me questions that he should know the answer to. \n\nMy other co-workers are really good people and by good I mean aholes. One guy plays erotic games most of his shift on the company computer and no one seems to care. Another lady is a busy body Christian looking to convert everyone and anyone she can find. If she spent more time working versus running around telling everyone to have a blessed day, she'd get more accomplished. The other co-workers pretty much annoy the living shit out of me. They call me and ask for answers or blind transfer callers to me. \n\nI know I need out of this job and I complain way more than I should. I should be happy I have a job. I should be happy I can barely afford my bills. Right right? Wrong! I've been looking everywhere else for work, but not many places are hiring near me. I'm so depressed with everything. My only motivation to go into work is for the check.\n\nI'm hoping someone who has worked in customer service hell knows my pain and would be willing to treat me to some cheesy noms tonight. I will **absolutely** pizza it forward on pay day. I'm willing to provide a copy of my paystub and will send you a message from my main account if needed. I am really a broken man and I have completely lost my faith in everyone. \n\nThank you for reading and I'm sorry this was too long winded.",

Have not got any help yet and would still like a pizza if anyone willing to spare me some.\n\nI'm not exactly a charity case (at least not yet) but I was planning on using that $50 for food, now it's going to a stinking overdraft fee instead. I work part time at a local church doing clean ups every Tuesday and Friday. It's not my main job but it helps out a whole lot. The problem is they pay me with these checks that are uncashable, they have to be deposited into an account. I have an ebanking account with Bank of America, every time I deposit a check I get charged a service fee at the end of the month. Well, guess what hit my bank last night? A couple service fees and an overdraft fee for good measure, just wonderful. So my account went from a positive few cents yesterday to negative $56 dollars today. Even when I put in my check I'll be overdrawn anyway, and if I can't come up with the difference they'll hit me for another $35 in a couple days.\n\nThey told me that overdraft protection would stop this kind of thing, but of coarse it doesn't do a thing against their fees so getting them removed isn't happening. I'm just glad I filled up my car the other night or I wouldn't have wheels next week. I get paid next Friday and thankfully my Mom is gonna send me some money in a couple days but I'm empty stomached between now and then. Would anybody mind tossing a pizza and some soda my way to tide me over? You'd earn a spot in my prayers tomorrow for sure. I'm just tired of life dumping on me, so if anyone would cut me a break I'd love you forever.",

Not just any bad luck, but the kind of bad luck that comes from a) either trying to be a good person and help people out or b) the kind of stupidity that can only result from people taking advantage of you. \n\nAbout three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and \"needed\" to move out of her mother's house. \n\nUnfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for \"extras\" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a \"payment plan\" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity. \n\nApartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud. \n\nShe still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings. \n\nEvery word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to \"pay\" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it. \n\nMy parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.\n\nMy history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.\n\nI have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job. \n\nIn August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me. \n\nThe financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own. \n\nJust recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. \n\nIt is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. \n\nWith vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything. \n\nBy the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3 \n\nEDIT: I am going to school for graphic design, I don't know much about reddit yet but if you want a graphic made for you to display, I'd be happy to do it in a repayment of faith and support for RAOP members. :) ",

So I got laid off. He offered my job but it was during the times when I'm in school so I couldn't take it.\n\nAfterwards I was glad I had another 2 other jobs to fall back on at school. The next day I went and talked to both teachers about the jobs, both hired me for another semester. The I go to the work study off and it turns out that wasn't the case. I had lost my work study job due to my school's budget being cut. \n\nAt least school was paid off with some money leftover for me to live off of along with the money I saved up from working. I know it will be hard for me to find a job since I am in school full time. Some free pizza would at least put a smile on my face (and some of my unemployed friends' faces as well) after this, along with saving me some money.\n\nIf it helps, I have done the past 3 gift exchanges all with at least one rematch.

We managed to scrape together rent for this month, but I'd really rather not eat rice for the next seven days as that is literally all we have left in our cupboard aside from some baking essentials. Rice, waffles, and cake, diet of champions...\n\nI would offer something in exchange but anything I can make costs more to ship than I will have for ages. If you want I can draw you something, I guess? Any help would be beyond appreciated and once he starts his job in a couple weeks, I will be sure to pay it forward!\n\n",

Never one to ask for much of anything.\n\nLately its just been a series of downfalls for me. First to start, my girlfriend left me around october. Right after I got a new job, that was fun. Getting put into the mental ward at the hospital cuz I got so damn depressed that I was gonna kill myself.\n\nThe second to come was the reapearance of the scabies i've been trying to get rid of that my ex girlfriend had given to me. She caught them SOMEWHERE and i'm STILL not sure how she got them. The Medicine costs a fortune and i was lucky to get the first tube for pretty much free, but then I lost my insurance.\n\nI've been trying and trying, day after day to make myself feel better - gifting people things like games on steam, pizza to close friends and helping other people like my coworker Ryan whom has a kid and a wife and always eats raman for his break because he's dirt broke all the time.\n\nI don't know what it is, and I sit here, hungry myself, cold cuz I don't have heating in my house because I heat it with propane and I don't even have enough money for that.\n\nOn top of it all, today i'm sitting here in pain because on my way to work (which i'm missing today due to this) I got hit by a car. I ride a bike so... You can kinda imagine what thats like. My back rim is mangled, luckily the person who hit me bought me a new rim and got me a ride home, but fuck. I'm just like... STOP THIS NONSENSE!\n\nSo all i'm asking for is some pizza guys. Anyone, it don't matter, small pie, it's whatever.\n\nI live in the New Jersey area in Mantua. Pats pizza is my favorite, but i'll go for pizza hut cuz I like most of their stuff too.\n\n\nThanks in advance for just reading. :)",

My arms are shaking, I can hardly walk without my heart beating furiously, and I just noticed that my voice shakes as well. If I show up to an interview like this I' afraid they'll think I'm a crackhead (I'm pretty skinny). The last substantial thing I ate was a sample of a sandwich from Jimmy Johns, (I asked for three and gave the other two to the homeless people I'd passed a block before) that was on Wednesday.\n\nI just need some sustenance, whether it be a pizza, sammich... shoo I'd be excited about a bag of breadsticks.\n\nIf anyone is gracious enough to help me out, I promise to return the favor and help people out on RAOP as soon as financially possible.\n\nThanks for your time!",

That's when I found her getting in a car and when I got closer I saw her kissing some guy that wasn't really my friend but I did know him through mutual friends. I dont know what to do, im just gunna drink a bit (not an alcoholic or anything) but I need to relax, I wasnt really in love with her but I was getting there and im just bummed out, I actually spent all my money on the movies I took her to today, and now just starving, depressed, drinking and craving a damn pizza. That would be awesome, not really expecting a pizza but that would be awesome, just had to rant a bit sorry guys.  ",

Normally I do a fairly good job, but this semesters worth of books cost about double what I had originally planned for. Normally this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but in a town this small it's very hard to find a job. So I was hoping that a nice meal would be just the break I needed before I get back to struggling through the rest of the semester.\n\nThanks for listening and have a wonderful day. &lt;3",

She's down at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL for the week because the hospitals and doctors here in Alabama have not been able to give her a clear diagnosis or course of treatment for what we can really only identify as a degenerative brain condition.  She's down there without her husband or any of her close friends right now, because none of us could afford to take time off work to be there with her - we pretty much all used up what vacation time we had on her last visit last month.\n\nUnderstandably, she's very freaked out and upset at being down there by herself and having to face the possibility of neurosurgery this week alone.  I'd like to try and cheer her up, but we spent all my \"able to spend this\" money just to help GET her down there ($500 just from me, and more from her husband and my girlfriend to cover it all).  Given that stress doesn't help her condition, it bothers me that she's under such pressure alone and I can't help any more than this.\n\nThat's why I'm asking you guys.  Can we get her a pizza from a stranger to help restore some of her feeling that things will be okay?",

Last month, I picked up an abandoned dog in the middle of a parking lot. Wasn't financially prepared to get a dog, she just kind of wandered into my life. Ended up bringing her home, getting her spayed and up to date on shots. Turns out she's heartworm positive, but the love of my life right now. Between vet bills and paying my pet deposit ($400...ugh), I realized today I have $404 in my account to last me until the end of the month, and bills haven't been paid yet. I was sitting there thinking about what I have in my pantry and what kind of meals I can make without grocery shopping for the rest of the month so I can still provide for my dog as well. \n\nAs I was coming home and turning into my neighborhood, a truck ran a stop sign and hit my car. I had to wait 45 minutes out in the sun waiting for the cops to get there/report to get written up. Come home, and to top everything off, my dog had peed on the carpet.\n\nIt's my birthday next week, but I'm stressed about finances, school, getting my dog up and healthy, and now on top of it, getting my damned car fixed. \n\nI've bought pizza before, and never thought I'd be on the asking end, but I can't think of anything right now that would make me feel just a little bit better. I will definitely be re-paying it back in the future. Just for now I'm in a bit of a bind. \n\nWilling to offer you any proof...I just need a reason to smile right now. \n",

Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.  \n  \nShortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's \"friend\" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the \"friend\" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.\n\nNaturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's \"friends\" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is \"still on tag\" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also \"on tag\". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.\n\nBy this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, \"thanks anyway\"s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.\n\nDefeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!\n\nEDIT: TL;DR, I helped out a criminal repair what was probably a stolen bicycle while surrounded by sketchy people and subsequently had to spend my dinner money on a replacement tool he broke so that I could fix my own ride.",

The landlord is always really lenient with my mother so it's understandable and pretty predictable that this would eventually happen due to how far my mother got behind. I immediately went to the bank, withdrew every dime I had, got a money order and took it to their land lord. \n\nI did this fully aware that I'd be without and with no regrets. My mother and sister having a roof over their head is far more important then me going a couple days without food. I have a well paying job and I'm rarely home which explains why I have no food in my refrigerator. I help people out whenever I get the chance. However, My belly is really screaming \"fuck you\" at the moment.. So it would be pretty rad if someone could loan me the money for a pizza. I get paid Monday, and I'm a lady of my word so you can best believe this will be paid back or paid forward. \n\nThe throwaway account is because I don't ask for help, I just don't. It's embarrassing and a touchy situation so I'd rather hide behind a bitch account. Growing up we were always needing help with something, and I really don't like asking for help.. However if someone is willing to help I WILL give you my account name, I can even give you my mothers number so you can verify this.",

I was on the verge of getting evicted when they hired me and I was able to turn that whole situation around because they took a chance on me. Now I'm more confident that even though I had been fired I immediately went out there to find more work. And even though I haven't been able to find more than a few temporary assignments I'm not discouraged about it.\n\nHowever I am not living so comfortably. I had been living very much month to month. And I was able to pay June rent I don't have much left for food. Since I had been working at a restaurant I just ate for free there. Now I applied for food stamps in California but am not able to get an interview for benefits until after the 4th of July weekend. I showed up to the office and waited all day only to tell me that I can't do anything until that interview.\n\nI've been paying for my food with change I find around the house. My unemployment check won't come until they do a phone interview on Friday with me. I won't have any money after I pay July's rent. And I definitely won't be able to pay utilities without the unemployment check. I don't want to seem like begging but I would pay it forward if you could help a fella out reddit.",

It's just me and my 3 kids hanging out tonight.  Anyone feel like sending a few medium pizzas our way?  The thank you pictures will be marvelous indeed.

Truth be told, I have a crush on a girl that I invited over tonight for a simple pizza/movies/maybe a little football evening. While I don't have any cash, I thought I had a credit card handy to cover it, and tonight was the only night she'd be available for another week (student/job), but she's \"really excited we could work this out tonight.\" So was I, until I realized the credit card expired at the end of August and I hadn't gotten my new card yet; likely shipped to my old address in Brooklyn. So on top of no food for the \"date\" (I'd like to think, also, no groceries due to the no money thing, paycheck doesn't come for a few days) I have no credit card as backup. No purchases for a few days it seems.\nI know that most people will read this and laugh at the mishaps of a hapless kid trying to chase a cute girl with poor planning, but I'm hoping that one person will relate to the irrational, and sometimes stupidly blind decisions we make when a pretty girl is excited to spend time with us. She loves chicken and pineapple pizza and I was hoping to come through with a simple surprise to make her smile off the bat.\nI can verify I'm a real, sane person at college with a real address that willingly accepts pizza deliveries if you want to be the ultimate wingman/wingwoman. Commit a RAOP.\n\nI'm located in Tallahassee, FL at Florida State University, btw",

We don't have much/any food in the house we can eat, we live by ourselves and no family nearby that we can count on.\n\nI know some people on here offer something small in exchange for the pizza (noticed one guy on here offered a rap xD), the only thing we can offer is really my fianc\u00e9e might be able to do a little drawing for you (she's a good artist), or I can offer a spare copy of a game on Steam.\n\nI know there are some good people out there on reddit and I hope one of them sees this.\n\nI have 2 job interviews next week, if I get either of them, after my first pay I will come back on here and buy someone else in need a pizza. It's only fair.\n\nThank you and sorry for the slight wall of text.\n\nAlso, just in case, we are in the UK.",

I could go on and on about my firstworldproblems, but I think you get the picture. \n\nWhat I'm asking for tonight is what I think will be a fair exchange.  \n\n1) YOU\n... provide the food. New Haven is arguably the pizza capitol of the world (I can hear the hisses already), and so there's plenty of pizza places out there we can set this up for, however...\nThere is also a really awesome website called OneButtonWenzel.com that allows you to a press a single button and order the ultimate buffalo chicken sandwich.  It's cheap, its easy, it supports a business - a great deal for you.\n\n2) I...\nWill do my best to give you a fair shake. I'm not going to make some sort of pitch that you're helping a dying college student over here - we do have a meal plan and everything, so I want to give you something of substance.  I will photograph the consumption of your order, while confirming as many Ivy League/Yale stereotypes as possible.  \nAS A BONUS\nIf you order two (2) WENZELS, my whole SUITE will get in on the action! That's right, you'll have a pictures of a room full of WASPY New England folks enjoying the delicious late night meal you have provided.\n\nOffers like this don't come around every day - now is the time for food.  I hope you'll join me in this venture.\n\n\nEDIT: Zombica has been kind enough to provide us with food, and so we'll do our part to provide the pictures while we are waiting for it to arrive. Delivery here is totally random, so it could be until 2:00am before they deliver - if that's the case, it is a risk we are willing to take.\n\nEDIT 2: The Wenzels arrived, and they were awesome. Check out the pics below, and give Zombica as much karma as possible - she is the best, and totally made our week.",

He has a volvo, so the external damage was minimal for a car crash, but the interior damage was bad. The windshield was cracked, a bunch of the paneling was destroyed, one of the front headlights was cracked and the airbags messed a bunch of things up. I think it's what messed up the front windshield. I hit my head and he got cuts and burns from the airbags and probably lost his car (nicknamed victor). \nThe other driver was honest about it, but the officer said that since it was on school ground (technically private property for some reason) he could not claim fault. So now my friend is going to have to battle with insurance on just getting his car fixed and the money for that. I'm going to try and drive him around whenever I have enough gas to go anywhere. Any help is appreciated and he was planning on getting some pizza today, but he said \"I just want to relax for now.\" Everyone decided to call off the little social gathering we had, but it would be sweet if he could still get a pizza.

I'd really hate to ask for any assistance from anyone, especially since there are more needy people out there, but we've kind of hit a snag and could really use the help.\n\nHere's the deal: I'm 22, and I live with my mom. We've been going through some pretty rough times as of late -- we're knee deep in debt, going through a foreclosure on our home, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for months on end. Mom works part-time at a hospital, and I've been looking for work for quite awhile, but as of yet nothing's come up. We've been living on what food my mom can get from her work (employees can get food in exchange for 'payroll reduction', where they take the charges right out of their paycheck), but this week's pay cycle just ran out, meaning we can't get any more food there until this coming week. Groceries haven't been a realistic possibility with our income lately, so until then, we're out of luck (and food) this weekend. We've got twenty dollars in the bank to cover gas, but that's about it.\n\nIn addition to all of this, my mom suffers from a myriad of health issues, so between that and all of the stress from our financial situation, she feels absolutely miserable. I'm hoping that maybe some delicious pizza would at least take her mind off things and brighten up her day a bit.  Again, I feel awful asking for help,  but any at all would be greatly appreciated, and when we can afford it, we will definitely be able donate a pizza or two here. \n",

My mom gets up at 5 in the morning sometimes earlier so she can get extra hours to get more money and being in a small town I have gotten a job as a babysitter but need to keep missing days because I have teeth problems. I have to go back to school next year to finish the classes I missed from being in a very abusive relationship so more money will be put towards that.

I have a couple wrinkled potatoes, frozen potato stuff, frozen fish, a little frozen fruit, about 10 eggs, some rice, a little bit of frozen peas, one packet of kool-aid and some coffee, and a box of macaroni and I can't eat any more of that stuff without puking - I just can't force any more of it down my throat like I have been the past two weeks. I had my laundry money planned out for this month to the quarter only to find the landlord increased cost per load by 50% without telling anyone so I'm tapped out of cash.

It is not to receive a pie, but for help.  \n\n**By ordering your Papa John's Pizza from www.pizza.gg you can save 50% and support the growing industry of competitive gaming.**  \n\nWhat is competitive Gaming? Competitive Gaming, or eSports, is a growing industry that has received a huge boom in viewership over the last few years with the advent of new Internet streaming services. Professionals on teams get paid to play games like /r/starcraft /r/leagueoflegends /r/DotA2 at the highest caliber. They battle it out in [tournaments](http://www.dota2.com/international/announcement/) for millions of dollars year round.  \n\nMillions of people watch this content every week. However we do not have sponsorship money coming in from Coke, Honda, Mcdonalds, or other mainstream companies. Papa John's is a serious contender in an effort to get more lifestyle sponsors into our growing industry. This is their first major fore into our industry. They are dipping their toes in. We want to blow their expectations away.  \n\nIf even a few of you make your papa john's orders by going through www.pizza.gg this week it will mean a lot to me and a bunch of other redditors. Thank you  \n\ntl;dr Save 50% help some dudes out who like to watch professional video games",

More of a reader than a talker I suppose. Anyways, my children's mother surprised me by dropping the kids off this morning, as she felt going to the lake with a new bf was important enough to warrant me taking a day off of work with no notice. I was supposed to have them this weekend, so I wasn't really prepared grocery wise. (None of this is her concern, but that whole thing is a story for a different subreddit.) If someone would like to make a couple of kids day a little better by giving them something besides ramen and toast, that would be great. I'm not creating this account just for this..I've been meaning to for a while and plan on posting a lot more, as well as paying this forward. Thanks for reading.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you newchel.

After that, my Mom remarried a man, who was very abusive. We lived on for about a year and then my Mom passed away. Both of my parents had cancer, I don't know if I do or not, I'm not 100% sure on how the genetics work with something like that.\n\nAnyways, I lived with him for about two years until I moved in with a family from a church. They were in their mid 50's, not at all a good age to raise a 12 year old apparently. They were beyond abrasive to me and just wasn't a good fit, but I had no choice. After about three years I moved up north with a family for about four months when they decided they were too young and busy for me. They were in their late twenties and they had just had two kids, again, not a good fit. I was kicked out on a moments notice had my aunt pick me up and drive me back to the cities. My aunt then proceeded to drop me off at her apartment and tell me that no one in my family is willing to take me in. I waited on the curb with all of my stuff, calling friends, until one of their families wanted to take me in. I lived with them for about two years until they decided they needed to move to Iowa, they offered to take me with, but I declined because a friend in school wanted me to graduate with him. I lived there until I graduated.\n\nAbout a week after I graduated, they had a death in the family and needed to use my room for company. I could certainly understand, so I moved into a place where a guy owns a house and just rents out rooms, found on craigslist. Being seventeen, I didn't have much of an option because most apartment buildings wouldn't allow me to move in being underage.\n\nI started working at a game store that I loved right near by where I lived, it was a place where I would put in like 40-60 hours a week, sometimes paid for overtime, most of the time not. I loved that store, but a year after I started, the store had to close down due to investor issues. I had about a week's notice and the closing day was the day before Christmas Eve. I was unemployed for a few months until I started working at another game store, but they lasted about four months after I started working there. \n\nCurrently, I'm working at a Car Wash while trying to get into something with gaming. I'm not aiming to make it though, I'm in debt to my landlords and I don't make nearly enough money to pay it back currently. I was a bright student, but I've had no opportunity to go to college or anything, I don't have the safety net of a family.\n\nMy phone is going to be turned off any minute, I owe Redbox money for a rental that I can't repay (Another stupidly long story), and I owe my landlord $525.00 on Sunday, and I currently have about $4 to my name. I have no where to turn for help, I'm just trying to enjoy the days I have left.\n\nIf someone would be willing to make tonight a great night by buying me a meal, I'd be forever grateful. \n\nThanks for reading, any words of encouragement would be appreciated too.",

I was bummed but kind of expecting it (cutbacks and such) and was able to score a few temp jobs here and there to keep my bank account stable, and seeing as my SO still had a full time job, we weren't terribly worried about the situation as a whole. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops. \n\nNormally to cheer ourselves up we go all out on cheap pizza (Dominos, Hungry Howies, etc.), but with our lack of incoming funds, it's something that we haven't been able to do, and I think it would definitely lift his spirit a bit. If any of you wonderful redditors could help, I would be super appreciative. I don't have much of anything to barter with, but I am willing to send you a few pieces of record art that I have made if you would like something in return. \n\nI know this whole thing probably sounds silly, but I need help getting him out of this funk and figure this is a great way to do it.

        "request_text_edit_aware": "Honestly, it's almost comical at this point looking at this past week. The amazingness started off with school. I had been working on this massive art project, however I was far behind because no matter what I would do, my teacher would come back saying that personally didn't like it. Not that it wasn't good, she just didn't like it. This put me back roughly 3 days behind everyone else in the class. Come Monday projects are getting turned in, and I don't have mine done because of how far behind I was because of her. She said too bad and told me to better manage my time. Even the other students in the class told her she wasn't being fair and it wasn't my fault. I just say okay, and work to get it in as soon as I can. Tuesday comes. I go into work after class, and go to look at my schedule for the next week. I'm scheduled for 12 hours. I go to ask one of my managers what's up because I literally can't even pay for my gas to drive to work on those hours. Apparently someone decided to start a rumor about me at work that I was tired of working there and that I was bad-mouthing the managers. Instead of coming to talk to me, they listened to the rumors and cut my hours. Wednesday comes around. I'm on my to school when my car starts acting funny. I'm on my way to class, and am almost at the school, so I just try and get the school where I can look at my car. I'm in the parking lot getting ready to pull into a spot when my car dies. Steam starts coming out from under the hood, I knew it had overheated. My temp gauge didn't show it was overheating so it told me that my thermometer was broken. I call my dad and tell him I'm stuck at the school, he says when he gets a chance he'll bring a thermometer up to me and we'd replace it at the school. I wait 20 minutes, start the car up again,  pull into the closest spot, and go to class. I come out from class and look under the hood. Radiator is empty and the resevoir tank is massively overfilled, leading to the thermometer again. I put water in my radiator, and try to start my car; nothing. I try again, hear a loud bang, get a big puff of smoke, and my car dies. I just cracked the engine block, meaning my car is dead. As a side note, my school and work is 40 minutes away one from where I live. I cannot live without having a car. So now I'm having to borrow my dad's car. Next comes Thursday. My parents are going through a very bad divorce, and my dad was having to travel to a different state for the trial. I get a call from him late in the afternoon, in which he's very upset with me. The day before I told my mom about my car, and told her I was using my dad's car, and then she asked how my dad was going to the trial. This was where I made my mistake: I told her that he was using his company credit card. Apparently she used this information in court against him, and it wasn't something even his lawyer knew about. Now my dad is upset with me because he thinks he can't say anything to me because I'll just go to my mom. I'm not talking to my mom right now because she took something I told her because I thought she would be concerned about me and instead just used it to her own advantage. Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.\n\nTL;DR: Cunt teacher, rumors at work leading to cut hours, cracked engine block, can't talk to either of my parents right now. Just another average week. ",

When I was capable, I gifted people in pizza as well.  I like the idea of sharing a meal rather than being paid directly, seems more friendly.  I'll see what I can do to eventually become a pizza gifter here.\n\nAnyway, if you feel like gifting me a pizza, there is a mom and pop pizza shop I can walk to here you could call and order a pizza directly.  They have a deal mon - wed with a medium one topping for $5.99, or large for like $2 more.  A while back, I had a friend order me a pizza directly with them, no problem.  I'm simple pizza wise - like pepperoni with extra sauce.\n\nI've been living mostly off of ramen (cold-cooked as I have no stove) and dollar menu at McDs, so  pizza would actually be nice.\n\nThis is a really cool subreddit.  Hopefully I'll be able to repay the kindness sooner rather than later by passing on a pizza to someone else in need.\n\nI live mid-way down the east coast, and will get more specific when I give whoever the details.  I wasn't asked for the card the time before, I'm thinking an out of state order would be fine.\n\nWow, if someone does this, thanks so much!  If not, still glad I found this subreddit.

His father passed away about a month ago from a massive heart attack (they call it a widow-maker heart attack, go figure), and we've just been slammed with a bunch of expenses. Jason, my son, is taking it really hard. He's about to turn 15, and his father was his idol.\n\nI would love to surprise him with a pizza some night, maybe get his mind off the whole situation, but I just can't swing it financially at this point, and was wondering if you were still helping out those within the community.\n\nIf not, I completely understand, you've provided a huge service to this community already, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.\n\nThank you so very much",

        "request_text_edit_aware": "Hello everyone. Recently I have been struggling to get by, I had about \u00a320 to my name. I decided to sell a ton of my stuff on Amazon to raise money for Christmas presents. So I managed to sell \u00a3350 worth of stuff (pretty much everything I had of value), but now Amazon says I have to wait til the 29th to cash out. So, I have no stuff, no money to buy Christmas presents, and I've used the \u00a320 I had to my name for postage. My friend told me about this site and how there are some wonderful people out there who will buy pizza for needy people. I have never really thought of myself as needy, but at this time, I am ashamed to say I am. I hardly slept last night as I was so hungry, I have been relying on a packet of lollipops that I bought for 4p, which I actually picked up as I was walking through the town centre - oh the shame! :( I have a very small family, and they all live 2 1/2 hours away on the train, so it looks like I'm stuck til I get paid on the 6th January. If I have any spare money after I get paid, I'll certainly buy another person a pizza.\n\nI am from the UK, but I'm sure if you're not from the UK it would be possible to get a pizza to me. I know this may seem like a lie because I have just registered, but really, I have never been on this site before, and I can provide proof of my bank balance, my packet of lollipops, etc if needed. Hopefully it won't come to that.\n\nI'd like to give my sincere thanks in advance to anyone who comes forward and fulfills my request. ",

All we has with us was a skillit, some vegetable oil, and some celebratory Goya Empanadas. Hey, we are college students, eating healthy isn't our forte. \n\n\nI put the oil on and asked him to keep an eye on it for me while I ran to the car to look for something. As I was doing that, he got an important phone call from work and forgot about the oil. I came in and the moment i shut the front door the oil spouted into a pillar of flame. Having nothing with us but the clothes on our backs, we had nothing to put out this oil fire with. \n\n\nInstead of letting our new home burn my boyfriend decided to bravely pick up the flaming skillit and take it outside. When the front door opened the flames rushed up and licked over his head giving him a few minor burns. This caused him to jerk away and made the burning oil spill all over his right hand.\n\n\nHe had to be skin grafted from his fingertips to his elbows. He has had to wear pressure garments since the burns healed. It is a tight, itchy, and generally uncomfortable skin tight glove and sleeve that has bothered him everyday since. But he just smiles and endures.\n\n\nHe just called me to say that the doctor told him he didn't need to wear his pressure garments anymore! I want to celebrate with him with a pizza, but money is tight given the medical bills. Would anyone be willing to help me thank my hero?",

I'm on PERMANENT BEDREST until I'm induced in December. I have preeclampsia, which means for no reason than my body hates my baby, I have extremely high blood pressure and I could have a seizure at any moment. (Both my mom and my grandma lost their first children to eclampsia, the onset of the seizures, so I'm GRATEFUL to have knowledge of my condition. The docs say my baby and I should be TOTALLY fine!)\n\nSorry for the sob story, I know that's not what this wonderful place is about, but I just thought I'd let you know background to WHY I want a pizza! I'm off of work, obvs, because I have to be in bed all day (no more than 5 minutes on my feet at a time!), and ALSO, **my husband can't cook for SHIT**, so I'd like to take some responsibility off of him for the next two nights or so by getting him a fat pizza gift card! We have all the normal joints in our neighborhood, so any gift card would be sweet!\n\nIt would help make sure myself and my unborn child are fed something that wasn't burnt and scraped off of the bottom of the wrong pan for the occasion!\n\nThanks in advance for your",

I was going to go grocery shopping when I got off work tonight, but when I went out to my car this morning, I had a flat tire with some sort of nail/spike sticking out of the side.  I had to buy a new tire so I can get back and forth to work.\n\nFriday, I got paid $112, giving me a total of just under $120 in my account.  The tire and labor came out to a little over $118, leaving me 82 cents in my account to last until Friday (payday).  So I wasn't able to buy groceries tonight.  \n\nIn the fridge, we have half a pack of american cheese, a head of lettuce, and soy milk.  In the cabinet, we have a pack of ramen, three slices of bread, and some chocolate syrup.  We live week to week, and we have a grocery budget, and we plan out a weekly menu, buying just what we need for that week's meals.\n\nI'm not going to pretend I've been on Reddit forever.  I created this account 8 months ago, but I never post.  I just come in once in a while to look at the funny stuff.  Tonight, I read an ABC news article about ROAP, and figured it was worth a shot.  If anyone is willing to help me out, we can survive on pizza for two days easily.    It's just my fiancee and myself.  \n\nI'm posting links to a screenshot of my bank balance, a photo of the tire receipt, and my latest paystub.\n\nThank you ahead of time for any help, and if no one can help, I still appreciate your taking the time to read all of this.  I know it's a lot, but the guidelines said to include details.  We have a Dominoe's down the street from us.\n\nSo, yeah.  Thanks again, either way.\n\nhttp://i51.tinypic.com/126fc6a.jpg\nhttp://i51.tinypic.com/30cwzgl.jpg\nhttp://i52.tinypic.com/2hnz9yu.jpg\nhttp://i56.tinypic.com/1gtc7t.png\n\n",

A couple of medical bills from the end of last year have put me WAY off my budget and I'm trying desperately to catch up. I'm behind on my mortgage, car and lights. On top of that I got stopped yesterday by the police while travelling from one job to the next and found out my license has been suspended from an old fine I forgot to pay.  So this morning I had to get my license straight, which costed $275 that I didn't have.  The best part was finding out on the way home this AM that my water got cut off.  That costed me another $180 that I didn't have.  I've never been so desperate in my life.\n\nI need help, more help than a single pizza, I know, but one meal would mean the world for me right now.  I've got nothing in the cupboards to cook tonight and the money I was planning to buy dinner with is GONE.  I get paid tomorrow so a little kindness tonight would go such a long way.  \n\nI have three children and they are the real reason I'm asking for this tonight. I have a daughter, 9YOA, and twin boys, 2YOA.  One of my sons has a congenital heart defect and has been through three surgeries.  I'm a paramedic and I'm working as hard as I can to provide for my kids and allow my wife to finish school.  \n\nI can provide proof if needed through PMs.  Please, someone, find it in your heart to assist me this one time.

It's an autoimmune disorder where the body freaks out over gluten, a protein in wheat, barley and rye (And most processed foods, due to cross-contamination in factories).\n\nSince then, I haven't been able to eat most breads, nor gluten-free foods processed in facilities where they might have gotten contaminated by something that contains gluten.  Obviously, this means pizza's out.\n\nWhen I first was diagnosed, I tried to eat gluten-free pizzas - they were all absolutely terrible, and I just gave up.\n\nI'm appealing to you guys, now.  **Pizza used to be my favorite food, and now I can't eat it.**  I live in Brooklyn, NY.  If anyone knows of a place in the borough that does decent, gluten-free pizza **that is also prepared in a celiac-friendly kitchen** (this is very important, just being made with gluten-free ingredients isn't enough), please let me know.  You don't even need to buy me any, just tell me that it exists and I'll go there myself first thing tomorrow.\n\nThanks for your time, redditors.  Have a slice and think of me!",

I will get my last paycheck in the mail (from the last Walmart I worked at) late next week, but my funds have dwindled from the move and I haven't been able to afford much more than a box of ramen to keep me full. I just learned that a church across the street from me runs a food pantry, but they're only open on Wednesdays. If a redditor would be kind enough to help me fill my belly this evening, I will gladly return the favor when funds return. Many thanks, Sarah",

I made lot of desperate attempts in the last month as the wedding got closer topping it off by pouring my heart out and basically begging her not to go through with it.  You can imagine how far any of that got me.  I actually spent yesterday believing I'd get word that she called it off.  I stayed up all night checking her facebook page to see if it happened.  At 8am I finally crashed.  A few hours later I woke up and there was the wedding picture, front and center.  A little bit after that she had her name changed on there, and that was that.  \n\nThe last thing I had to eat was a granola bar for breakfast yesterday.  I've got no food in the house, and quite honestly, I've started drinking and driving wouldn't be the best idea.  And you know what?  I'm going to keep drinking.  Part of me knows that I should eat though, or it's going to be that much worse tomorrow.  I've got no money though, no food, but plenty of drink.  I'm going to continue torturing myself tonight, and tomorrow will be a new day.  Tonight I wallow though.  It hurts.\n\nCheers!\n\nP.S.  Am I the only one who thinks that the first wedding your kids are in shouldn't be one of their parents?",

Basically, we're both out of work right now, and life just kinda sucks. We've both had to drop out for the semester, missed too many classes due to not having enough gas. We're looking for full-time work, but so far the 6 temp agencies we both signed up for haven't called. \n\nOne redditor was willing to donate a very generous $150, but it won't be transfered to my bank via Paypal until Friday or Monday. Our pets have food for the moment, but their humans are very hungry! Our cabinets/fridge are basically bare, other than spices and seasoning. We used up the last of our leftovers yesterday, and now we're down to bread, peanut butter, and water. And we've had a LOT of peanut butter, bread, and water lately. I hate to ask, but we literally don't even have a dollar until that money shows up.\n\nIf anyone wanted to send us a pizza or two, that'd be amazing. Signed up for a verification code just in case ;). We'd be more than willing to send you pizza(s) back when our transfer goes through, pay it forward to some other person here in need, or provide any variety of services as part of the agreement. Also, FWIW, we're in Bonner Springs, Kansas. Have Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and Dominos/Papa Johns within pick-up distance.\n\nPlease?",

I have 700 bucks in my account and dont get paid for 2 weeks. My rent is $1200. Needless to say I am freaking out. \n\nI havent been shopping for food for 2 weeks, I have beans and rice left thank god.. Im starting to look like shaggy from scooby doo since I cant afford a hair cut. Im using TP from my work and dandruff shampoo as hand soap. There have been better days.\n\nLook, I have been a RAoP reader for a while and I have always wanted to buy some deserving stranger a pizza. I know that there are people who deserve this more than me. Its kind of depressing having my first post here be a request. But this is my promise, the second I can afford to help others here, I will.

At the beginning of the month, my father passed away, leaving my husband and I to beg off family to pay for the plane ticket to Texas. Worth it to say goodbye to my daddy, but still horrible. When we got back my husband discovered he was not being hired as a teacher at the school he worked at for the following year because he wasn't catholic enough (yes, it was a Catholic school board). This after two years of working for this board, being an active member of the school community, and being loved by all of the students and their parents. He was devastated.\nRight now he is sitting at the kitchen table filling out application after application... We have $20 inour bank account and his last paycheck, coming in two weeks has to be spent for our big move to Toronto in a month. I am unemployed (I'm immigrating to Canada and they haven't issued a work visa yet) and just want to see my husband have something super neat and nice happen. Earlier he came into the room and said he wished we could order a pizza... Half an hour later I found this! \nI'm willing to provide any proof you ask for and as soon as we are on our feet again I wOuld love to return the favor! Is there anyone willing to give a random act of pizza to a couple looking to smile at least once this month?!\n\nUPDATE:\nDinner box arrived! Here are some pictures of my husband and I with our amazing treat from Belgar! My husband was so freakin' surprised! It was awesome! So thank you for totally making out evening!! Also, sorry if I'm doing this wrong!!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9BPcd\n\nSeriously, best meal I've had in awhile! :D\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VVWEJ.jpg",

Now he's decided that we should have pizza tonight, and their kid and our two kids are all excited, and that's great.  I just would really like to be able to pay for one thing this entire trip that they're here.  I've been unemployed for almost six months.  My wife is a bartender, and she's at work now, and we're hoping she makes at least $100 to cover the checks that are out for rent and bills.  I don't have any extra money to spend on pizza, but I'm tired of feeling worthless while they take care of everything.  There are six of us, and I'd like to be able to pick up a couple of pies and at least feel human again.  It's funny how being on here and asking strangers for help somehow seems less demeaning than taking help from family.  I don't know.  Just figured I'd ask.  Thanks for listening.

My younger brother also lives here (23) and corrals shopping carts at the local Wal-Mart part-time with an associates degree in IT. My mother is laid off from the Heinz manufacturing facility she works at for the next 2 weeks so money is even tighter. It would be nice to suddenly have pizza and surprise everyone here ;)... where it is ordered from doesn't bother me, I have never been picky. \n\nThought I would try this out and ask.

Recently we've been going paycheck to paycheck with the little we have over going to food, and lawyers fees (custody battle). I was saving a little aside for his birthday, but unfortunately since I work on commission, it didn't come through the past two weeks. I only had money to pay bills and rent.\n\nI was hoping anyone that had a spare moment and some cash could help me buy a pizza for him this afternoon. We can even consider it a loan. I will pay you back. \n\nThanks for listening.",

Before I continue, I just want everyone to know that this isnt my usual reddit account, its a throwaway, as my friends know my other account and I wouldnt want them to see this post. But I would have no problem verifying my usual reddit account with any potential pizza givers. I also have a verification number from the RAOP website.\n\nAnyway, I just woke up. Its 4 am in Ontario, and I dont think many pizza places are open until around 11 am. Me and my two siblings dont really have much here to eat. Im 22 by the way. My siblings are 18 and 17.\n\nAnd I have about 14 dollars cash, I was just going to buy a some pasta, hamburger, some cans of soup, and a couple boxes of kraft dinner for the weekend. But it'd be nice to have a pizza to eat around lunch today.\n\nIm not sure if I should be posting this now, or later when its a more appropriate time.\n\nAnyway thanks again.",

However, it was a $1/hour paycut AND I only get half the hours I used to get.  I had to use my entire first paycheck to pay utilities, phone bill, and the money I owed on my (store) credit card (good credit &gt; fun things).  \n\nI (luckily) have a pantry full of pasta (I decided that $10/10 boxes of pasta was a good idea a few months ago and that's a lot of pasta) and a few cans of beans and half of a 5lb bag of rice, as well as sauces and syrups for those guys.  I also have a lot of baking things.  I'm definitely not short on food, but it's getting a bit monotonous eating only this, especially since I have to do it 'till next Thursday.\n\nI only have $16 until next Friday's paycheck and I'd like to spice up my life with a treat this weekend!  I live in Minneapolis and I'm in the delivery area of Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Domino's, and a local favorite (though much more expensive), Pizza Luce.  If anyone's willing to order me a medium cheese or pepperoni pizza for carryout or delivery (I can pay tip with the $2 I found on my way home yesterday if it's delivery, or I can bus/bike to pick up from any of those locations!) I would love you forever!  I don't owe rent next month (because I had to pay the last month of rent when I signed my lease) so I will be passing it on as soon as I get my paycheck!\n\nThanks so much!",

Some users send a T-shirt to people who win more than X games in a row.\n\nWould RAOP be interested in providing a pizza to the winner of a raffle?

Players who lose are given 2 entries, and winners would be given 3 entries per win.\n\nI'm sorry if I violated any rules of this subreddit.

I had taken her across the country to make sure she could meet all of my family, especially my grandparents while they're still alive. Everything was going great until... well.... She broke up with me rather suddenly. The reasons she gives make it seem like she's hiding something from me. We never had any real problems. The fact is, I hardly feel like getting out of bed in the morning. I still go to work to pay my bills, but I don't really have any friends in my town anymore, and my family lives far away. My roommate is pretty much all I have left around here. Everything around here reminds me of times that I spent with my beloved, but it's all been shattered.\n\nI feel completely devastated. She was my life. I'd love to feel a little bit of the love that you good folks are spreading around if you could share it. I'll get a verification code as necessary.

I parked my car in my apartment complexes parking lot over night and when I woke up the next morning to head to work I saw that my windshield had looked like it was hit with a baseball bat.\n\n[A picture of my windshield](http://i.imgur.com/TjMr1ml.jpg)\n\nSo anyway, I call a local glass shop to get my window fixed and they say they can do it the next day while I'm at work.  The next day happens and I am getting ready to leave work and my windshield is still broken.  Because they couldn't keep to their schedule, I decided to cancel with them and call a separate place.  They come and fix it the next day and were super professional about the entire thing.  However, when they replaced the windshield they took my parking permit for my apartment complex with the old windshield.  So now I have been having to find street parking every day until my apartment complex's office is open so I can try to get a new one from them.  I am just lucky I saw that my sticker was gone before my car got towed. \n\nAnyway, tldr; My car windshield got hit with what looks like a baseball bat and would appreciate some pizza!",

I was laid off from my job of 4 years 3 weeks ago.  After an intense job search, I was hired into an OK paying new job a week later(dancedancedance!) and everything is going fantastic there.  Their pay schedule is harsh (paid in arrears 1 week + 2 week delay = 3 weeks no pay) and I'm not due for a pay check until Friday.  My final paycheck  from my last job went into paying rent/keeping the power on/getting a bus pass etc etc. I'm the frugal type but even with my efficient spending, over the last few weeks I've dropped a lot of weight (down to 5'10\" 125lbs). So just putting this out there since I'm darn hungry. Any kindness will be returned in the form of filling a request when I'm back up and running financially.  Vancouver, Washington is right next to Portland, Oregon. ... Northwest USA.\n\nThank you all for reading and for being there.  Happy Holidays to everyone!",

Sadly, she passed away last month, but thankfully is no longer suffering. \n\nI've been back for about 3 weeks and have been having a very hard time finding work. I assume because it is a college town and during the summer many businesses are cutting staff and hours till the students come back in the fall.\n\nI am working hard to get my life back in order after the loss of my mother and would appreciate from the bottom of my heart if someone was willing to donate a pizza for me to have tonight. My income has been extremely limited since helping to pay for funeral cost, my apartment's deposit and first month of rent, and bills, so any food is a blessing.

Long story short, I'm out of money and quite low on food for the next week or so, mainly due to the fact that I was forced to go to the ER last Friday because of a serious burn on my foot and, of course, I don't have any insurance. This wiped out my whole bank account, which then got overdrawn due to car insurance and a couple of checks that I had written a few days before. I'm starving tonight and I've basically only eaten fried eggs and toast this whole week. I understand if no one can help, but if anyone can help me out with some food for the night I would never forget it. As soon as I can get my bank account back in the positive I will definitely hop on here and help someone in need. I don't really know how this works (do you order it over the internet usually? Do I have to cover the tip?) so bear with me if it takes a couple of PM's. I'll be on Reddit all night, as usual, so I should respond quite quickly to any offers. Once again, thank all of you!

This is New England where things get super cold super fast. I am one of those things and the blankets aren't cutting it. :/\n\nBecause of the first couple weeks of classes, I haven't had a chance to grocery shop extensively, only buying fruits and cereal and bread what have you. I've now exhausted all of that. Now I'm out of money too, so I can't even get take out.\n\nI do have money put away for college, but my mother back home insists on regulating it for me. She's probably right to do so, however her boyfriend surprised her with a trip to the carribean. Meaning, now I need money from my account, but can't have it transfered because she is away.\n\nToday's just a shit day: I'm sick, I'm cold, and my money is just out of reach.\n\nMay I please have a pizza so I can lay on it to stay warm/eat it while sobbing?",

I also have been coding for 64labs.com but the CEO told me he had no money to pay me. I thought it was my big break to getting a job. In the end, i'm hungry.

Then I get home today and boot up my new laptop, its wonderful I saved for 6 months to pay for it, I can play every game that's out on ultra settings and have great FPS. After about 20 mins of playing some Skyrim it just shuts off, won't turn on. Hours of tech support online/calling ASUS, I find i have to send it in for repairs/replacement and won't get it back for up to 2-3 weeks. On my old computer now reading reddit and feeling bad.

Things are moving much slower than I expected, but nobody said it would be easy. I think I have a chance to make some money this coming week, but until then this is what I'm stuck with.\n\nI've never been in this place before, I've always had some kind of job since I started working in high school, so I've always had some backup cash. Well once school runs out and the loans are dry here I am, pretty fucked. Dad's helping with rent and bills each month, but I'm ashamed as it is to take money from him, I can't possibly ask for more until he offers it, especially since he tells me they've cut his pay at his current position.\n\nMy roommate has been out of town too, and she owes me $50 for her half of the electric, but won't be back in town until Tuesday. Meanwhile, I sit here in the apartment working, trying not to leave lest I spend money or gas, with a near empty kitchen. And I've just run out of bud too. . .\n\nI really enjoy just plain cheese pizza, or maybe cheese and bacon or something simple. It's the simple, little things in life anyway.",

Once I have money, I plan to be a random-pizza-giver :3\n\nSo backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, \"Today I'm going to try heroin.\"\n\nIt was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?\n\nWell eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.\n\nSo yeah. That's my story. This is me [before and after](http://imgur.com/blBMtWH) getting my shit together.\n\nThanks for reading this, if you did :) otherwise,\n\n**TL;DR: Bad guy, PTSD, heroin, recovery, can I have pizza now please?**",

The house (especally upstairs) has little to no air condition, and it's really hot. I was hoping to offer a pizza for them for dinner when the work is done?\n\nThey really should get to eat, and we don't have the money, or food in the house, to feed them. So if anyone wants to buy us a pizza or 2 to share, that would be fantastic. \n\nIf you want proof of my parent's work, I can provide that. \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: Ok, grandma messed up and mom and dad left.

Well, I'm finishing up with a really long week of backstage work and if I could have a pizza when I got home later tonight, it would make me such a happy boy.\n\nI didn't believe it, but here I am. I'm an avid fan of Star Trek, Archer, and theater to give you a little info about myself. \n\nAnyone willing to help will receive a long distance air-five and lots of appreciation from my empty belly. :D",

I hate asking for assistance from others but Ive never been in this bind before and I'm really hoping someone out there could bless us with a pizza for dinner. It would be amazing, and I would be more than happy to pay it forward with my first check to another needy family facing the same difficulties as we are at the moment.

As bad as that is, she took our EBT card right before we were to go grocery shopping, leaving me heartbroken, alone, and without food with a week to go before my next paycheck. My stomach growling is honestly the least of my problems at this point, but I was told this would be a good place to try to get some dinner and solve at least one of my issues, or at least an open ear.

As I said my grace and waited for the food to cool down, I was overwhelmed by a million thoughts.  I just wanted to share them and maybe let someone know they're not alone.\n\nLast week I \"celebrated\" one year of being unemployed.  Ironically it coincided with 6 months of being officially divorced, though the marriage was over long before that.  Today marks two weeks since I scrounged around the house to find every penny and spent them all to cover the bills.  For 2 weeks I've tried to get by without any money.  I've restricted my use of the car to only places I absolutely had to go.  I haven't been to the grocery store in God knows how long.  The first week wasn't awful.  I didn't have much in terms of food around the house, but it forced me to be creative.  This second week has been much less enjoyable.  Some cereal, some pasta, a little of this, and less of that.  You don't realize how long two weeks is until you find yourself counting down every day.  I am hoping to get some relief in terms of an unemployment check on Wednesday.  What I was told though is it could be delayed because I have to re-qualify after one year.  What a proud moment for me.  I've run into issues before, and it doesn't matter that it's not your fault, they usually can't get the money to you until the following Monday.  We'll see how that goes.  I've had Wednesday circled on the calendar in my head as this all magical day.  Realistically most of the money is already spoken for in upcoming bills, but I'll have a little bit of money for grocery shopping.  Right now, and I realize this is a gross combination, I'm craving a glass of milk, and a hamburger :)  \n\nAnyway, the short story is that life sucks right now and I was kind of getting down.  Actually I was really in a bad place.  And as I said a blessing over the \"meal\", I realized that there are millions of people that would gladly step into my shoes.  That my life may seem rough right now, but that's more of a testament to how far I had risen, than to how far I've fallen.  \n\nI just want to say thank you to all of you on here that are helping people.  It's an honorable calling.  And to all of you that truly need help, just know that it will get better.  I firmly believe that we will never be given more than we can handle, and we're never in it alone.  I know how sad and depressing life can be, but I also know how you don't have to look far to find someone who needs help more than ourselves.  \n\nI guess I just wanted to say hang in there.  To everyone.  Keep fighting.  Don't give up.  If you're having a bad day, if you want to rant and rave or scream and cry, send me a message.  If you got that job interview you've been praying for, let me know.  I want to hear the bad.  I want to share in the good.  I have tried to weather the storm alone, and it doesn't work.  I don't need someone to carry me, but it sure is nice to have someone to lean on.\n\nSo as Tiny Tim say, \"God bless us, everyone.\"\n",

I've been browsing reddit for quite awhile, not posting much, but constantly upvoting cool or funny stories. TIL that there's a subreddit for people to pay forward pizza. So, here we are. For the past two paychecks, I've been dead broke, paying bills. I still have to pay 300$ to my ex, 200$ to my credit card, 100$ this month for bills, and then yesterday i got four tickets, two in my moms name, and two in my aunts, for stuff I couldn't take care of at the beginning of the month. Grass, because I had no mower, and trash because people keep running over my trash cans. So I have no idea what im going to do about those yet. I'll probably have to end up paying them. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's my turn to cook for myself, and my two friends who are living with me trying to help me keep the place clean. For the past week they've been cooking delicious meals filled with juicy chicken and scrumptious ground beef. So... I would feel kind of bad just making ramen for them. So, two pizzas would go a long way. Fortunately, on this upcoming check, I have 5 hours of overtime pay, so I would be more than happy to push back the creditcard bill for a little while to return the favor. The deed doesn't need to be done for another 4-10 hours, I just figured that I would post it now so it could get some time to be noticed. Thanks in advance.\n\nTL;DR. Got 99 problems, but paying back a nice favor ain't one. Or Have ridiculous bills to pay, city is fucking me over with four tickets for two offenses that I corrected weeks ago, and it's my turn to provide food, but all I have left to cook is ramen, and a dollar bill. Getting 5 hours overtime on payday, and can easily return the favor.\n\n\nThat text was copy pasta'd from r/randomactsofpizza, seeing as how I didn't know this was the real one.  More info:  One of my roommates figured out that I posted this, and he's fine with cooking until I get paid, but I would still like to give them a break on cooking for a day, or possibly two if I happen to get 2 pizzas.  Plus, I would really like to pay it forward.  So, it's RAOP's call.  :]  Pizza would be nice, but I suppose not 100% needed.  Once again, thanks in advance.",

Even after being declared Cancer free, the nagging worry of a return just festers inside of you.  I finally made it to only having one test a year, and no more nightmarish CAT scans. Today was my first yearly result call. \n\nYou expect anything but good new, because you prep yourself for worst thing he could possibly say.  You brace yourself in defense of it, for weeks after they draw the blood from your veins.  It builds and builds up until that call.  And then it comes.  That intolerable small talk when the Doctor first gets on the line.  It's a pleasant exchange, though the entire time, you're mind is screaming \"SAY IT, SAY IT DAMN YOU, WHAT DID THE BLOOD LOOK LIKE!?  YOU SAVED MY LIFE BUT I WILL LOSE IT IF WE TALK ABOUT MY COLLEGE OR THE WEATHER FOR ANOTHER MOMENT!\".    \n\n\"No changes, which is a good thing\".\n\nDeafening relief.\n\nThe world just somehow looks better after this call, it smells better, everything is vivid, clearer, more alive.  Please help me with a celebration meal worthy of this feeling.  My favorite pizza, I do not have the funds for it.  I can think of nothing else right now that I would enoy more than a simple Large Bacon Pineapple Pizza from Dominoes with BBQ sauce instead of marinara.

You doin' alright? \n\nThis is my first post, and I'm not sure if I'm doin' this right (oh please correct me if I'm doing it wrong!) but here goes, here's why I wish I had a pizza right now (prepare for dramalama): \n\n**The worst:** I just had to tell this girl, the sweetest, funnest, cutest one you could ever imagine, that I didn't feel the same way about her that she did about me. Yes, I would sing her praises yet don't reciprocate, why? I've known her since we were kids, and since we've grown up, I absolutely can't see her as anything more than a little sister. She's never been quite lucky in love, and every fiber of my being knows she deserves more than a \"no\" from anyone, yet I can't be the one to do it -- I would be lying to myself and to her. Uggghhh, seeing her in this state, and knowing I caused it, is really taking it's toll on me. I've been dreaming about her, and even in my dreams I can't feel the same way, making me wake up only an hour or two into my sleep and unable to go back to sleep due to feeling so miserable. \n\n**The kind-of okay:** Aside from that, I simply don't have any food in the house right now, and my only ride out of this mountainous region isn't coming until (hopefully?) tomorrow, so that I may go get groceries. \n\nSo, not having pizza in a long-ass time, I feel like one would definitely bring an umbrella to this raincloud party, as well as tie me over until my friend gets back up here.

I am not someone who is out to score a free meal, I am honestly looking for some help right now.\n\nOK so here is my story. I apologize in advance for the giant wall-of-text.\n\nA couple of months ago our ceiling caved in, due to excessive rain and the landlord's refusal to fix the leak. We had been telling him for months that it was not fixed and it was still leaking, but he didn't care.\n\nSo the night that the ceiling caved in, I called the landlord and I told him politely, \"hey, your ceiling just fell in on us\"\n\nHis exact words, were \"I don't really give a damn, I don't care about anything since you said you don't owe me any money\"\n\nNow this is funny, because for years this landlord would come around EVERY YEAR at tax time, and insist we owed him some insane amount of money. We had just been agreeing in the past, because it was possible we might have missed some payments here or there.\n\nBut this time was different. He claimed we owed him 3,400 dollars for 8 months of rent that we supposedly never paid him. So I tell him, give me the dates that you think we didn't pay, and I will run them against my receipts and see what's going on.\n\nWell, when I finally get the dates, I cross-reference them to my receipts. And it turned out that we had actually OVER-PAID the landlord by 750 dollars - plus we had all the paperwork to prove it.\n\nSo I try to explain the situation with the guy, and he refuses to listen. So he files an eviction.\n\nWe go to court with photographs of the ceiling caved in that he refused to fix, the stack of receipts, his dates that he claimed we never paid - EVERYTHING.\n\nWell the judge's exact words were \"I'm not too good with numbers, so we aren't going to get in to your stack of receipts\"\n\nThe landlord also claimed that he never got the money orders, so I contacted Western Union, and I had them send me the front AND backs of them to show who they were made out to, and who signed and cashed them. Even after seeing these, he STILL claimed in front of the judge that he never got them - But they were clearly signed by him!!!\n\nSo the judge gave us 72 hours to get our shit and get out, when we were legally paid up for another 2 months........\n\nSo I had to spend 200 dollars on a storage unit, and we packed our entire lives into it. At this point, we are literally homeless. So I get a hotel room for myself, my fiancee, and our chocolate lab for the next week, just to have somewhere to sleep at night.\n\nSo that's another 200 dollars gone when we were actually paid up on the apartment and were wrongfully evicted.\n\nAfter about 4 days in the hotel, we came in contact with the lady we are renting from now - she had a house available, this house - But it's 500 dollars/month for rent, plus utility costs...\n\nEither way, we can't live out of a hotel at 200 dollars per week. So we agree and move in.\n\nThe house doesn't have a refrigerator, it doesn't have a washer/dryer. So we lived out of a cooler for the first month that we got here, until we were able to buy a cheap 75 dollar refrigerator.\n\nThis story just keeps going on &amp; on &amp; on.. I honestly couldn't type this whole thing out unless I wrote for a month.. This whole situation has just been insane.\n\nBottom line, I hate to ask for help. Especially like this.. \n\nBut I do have photos of the entire process. From moving our things into storage to us living out of the hotel room, all the way up until we found this house, to today's rent payment.. I have the photos.. I have the receipts, I have everything...\n\nSo, the reason I am asking today is because we just spent our last 500 dollars that we had in the bank on the rent for the next month.\n\nNeither of us gets paid for another 2 weeks.\n\nIf anyone can afford like 20 dollars or something so I could surprise her when she gets home from work with a pizza, some cheese sticks and a 2 liter of pepsi, that would be awesome. \n\nAs far as proof goes, I can provide a scanned copy of the money order for the rent that I just sent out today, it was our last drop of money. (After we were evicted illegally, I now scan the front of the money order before sending them to prove who they were made out to if any disputes should ever come up.)\n\nI would of course blank the recipient's name out, along with the address. But I would highlight the date it was purchased (today) so you can see that I'm not just making up some sob story. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried...\n\nSo anyway, again I apologize for the huge wall of text. If someone can help us, I deeply appreciate it and thank you in advance. If not, well at least I tried. It's better to try and fail, than not try and wonder what may have happened.\n",

With bills getting in the way we have no money for food.  I made the last of our food last night.  I know it is not much but but I have read some of the amazing posts of people finding the kindness in their hearts to give.  When we are forced to move we may not even have a place to go but that's really not the point of this is it?  Anyway I know a pizza won't feed us until the end of the month however it will help.
